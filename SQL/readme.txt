Project: Food Delivery Insights
Tools: SQL (CTEs, Window Functions, Joins, Aggregations)
Description:
Designed and executed a series of advanced SQL queries to extract business insights from a 
simulated food delivery platform dataset. Created a custom dataset with realistic attributes 
such as customer behaviour, order timing, cuisine types, and promo code usage.

* Built SQL queries to identify top-performing outlets by cuisine without using LIMIT or TOP.
* Analyzed customer acquisition trends by calculating daily new user counts.
* Detected one-time users who ordered only in a specific timeframe (e.g., Jan 2025), helping 
identify potential app deserters.
* Profiled users acquired via promotional codes who became inactive within 30 days.
* Demonstrated proficiency in Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, 
and query optimization using joins instead of subqueries.

Impact: Showcased ability to draw actionable insights that support marketing strategy,
retention efforts, and operational decisions in a delivery-based business model.
